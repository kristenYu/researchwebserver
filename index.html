   <b>Invitation to Participate:</b> We invite you to participate in this study the effect of AI directors on player experience. Participation in this study is completely voluntary.<br> <br>

   
   <b>Purpose of the Study:</b> The purpose of this study is to help understand the effects of different AI director algorithms on the player experience. AI directors are a tool that has been used in several industry game to help affect and shape the player experience in published games, but there is little academic understanding of the kinds of impact the AI director can have in a game. In order to start building an understanding of these tools, participants will play the same game with two different AI director algorithms implemented, and will be asked questions about their experience. We believe this will provide some insight on how the AI director might be shaping the player experience, as previous attempts to do so have had mixed results and there is no clear understanding of why these tools are effective in games. <br> <br>
   
   <b>Participation: </b> This study lasts approximately one hour. If you wish to participate in this study, you will be asked to play a game that was developed by the researcher. Then, there will be a short questionnaire to ask about your experience. Then, you will play the same game again, but with a different AI algorithm. Again, there will be a short questionnaire to ask about the experience. This will be followed by a longer questionnaire, which will include a comparison section, as well as some questions about experience playing games and personal preferences playing games. You are free to stop the study at any time by closing the browser, and if you do so your data will be removed from the study. Once the study has been completed there is no way to remove your data from the study. <br> <br>


   <b>Benefits:</b> The only potential benefit is the fun you might experience from playing the game.<br> <br>

   <b>Risks: </b> The only risk associated with this study is the risks of using a computer. <br> <br>

   <b>Confidentiality:</b> The dataset created this study will be published and made publicly available. Results will be published in pooled (aggregate) format or using an anonymous identifier. <br> <br>


   <b>Anonymity:</b> There is no directly personally identifying information collected in this study. We will not ask you for your name, address or similar information. When you choose to participate in the study, you will be assigned a randomly generated unique identifier, and all of the collected data will be associated with this unique identifier. There will be some amount of secondary personal information collected, such as experience playing games or preferred types of games. Given the nature of this secondary personal information collected, it is extremely unlikely that your data could be identified. In the published paper and in the dataset, aggregated data or unique identifiers will be used.
   Data Storage: The data from this study will be directly collected to a server at the University of Alberta. All data will be stored in digital files.  The data from this study will be stored for a minimum of 5 years as per University of Alberta policy. After the study, the data will be published as a dataset that will be widely accessible to the academic community. <br> <br>


   <b> Compensation (or Reimbursement): </b> There is no compensation for taking part in this study.<br> <br>

   <b>Voluntary Participation:</b> You are under no obligation to take part and if you choose to, you may stop participating at any time during the study. If you close the browser during the study, your data will stop being sent to the server, and all partial datasets will be removed from the study.
Once you have completed the study, there is no way to remove your data from the study since we do not collect any directly identifying information.
Information about the Study Results: We will publish study results in a conference paper. These papers will be made publicly available through the websites of the investigators.<br> <br> 

<b>Contact Information:</b>  If you have any questions or need any more information about the study itself, please contact us. You may contact the researchers at the emails mentioned above. <br> <br> 
The plan for this study has been reviewed by a Research Ethics Board at the University of Alberta, ethics ID number (Pro00129326).  If you have any questions regarding your rights as a research participant or how the research is being conducted you may contact the Research Ethics Office at 780-492-2615  <br> <br>

Please be aware that this study will take approximately 1 hour. If you need it, get water or food before starting the study. <br> <br>
